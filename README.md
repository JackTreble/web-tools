# web-tools

Small, local-first browser utilities published at https://tools.treble.dev.

## Goals

- 100% client-side tools
- no accounts, tracking, or uploads
- simple static files that run on GitHub Pages
- useful pages that are easy to find via search

## Current tools

- [tools/print-without-black.html](tools/print-without-black.html) — convert PDF blacks to printable color when a black cartridge is empty
- [tools/pdf-redactor.html](tools/pdf-redactor.html) — permanently redact PDF regions in the browser
- [tools/video-trimmer-gif-exporter.html](tools/video-trimmer-gif-exporter.html) — trim local videos and export GIF/WebP/MP4 clips

## Project structure

- [tools/index.html](tools/index.html) — landing page for the tool collection
- [tools/common.css](tools/common.css) — shared tokens and UI primitives used by tool pages
- [tools/template.html](tools/template.html) — starter template for new tool pages
- [tools/print-without-black.html](tools/print-without-black.html) — print-without-black tool entry page
- [tools/print-without-black/style.css](tools/print-without-black/style.css) — print-without-black styles
- [tools/pdf-redactor.html](tools/pdf-redactor.html) — PDF redaction tool entry page
- [tools/video-trimmer-gif-exporter.html](tools/video-trimmer-gif-exporter.html) — video trimmer tool entry page
- [tools/pdf-redactor/main.js](tools/pdf-redactor/main.js) — PDF redactor logic
- [tools/pdf-redactor/style.css](tools/pdf-redactor/style.css) — PDF redactor styles
- [specs](specs) — feature notes and planning docs that are still useful to keep in-repo

## Working on the site

There is no build step. Open files in `/tools/*.html` directly in a browser or serve the folder as a static site.

Third-party browser libraries are loaded from committed files in [tools/vendor](tools/vendor), not external CDNs.

## Delivery workflow

This repository uses a multi-stage workflow to move from idea discovery to shipped tools.

### 1) Researcher — discover net-new tool ideas

- Workflow: [.github/workflows/researcher.md](.github/workflows/researcher.md)
- Purpose: find browser-first opportunities that are not duplicates of existing specs/issues.
- Output: proposal issues with evidence, scope rationale, and browser API feasibility.

### 2) Product Architect — turn approved ideas into planning artifacts

- Workflow: [.github/workflows/product-architect.md](.github/workflows/product-architect.md)
- Trigger: approved issue labels.
- Purpose: generate/update planning artifacts under [specs](specs), including `spec.md` and `tasks.md`.
- Output: planning PRs that define what should be built.

### 3) Lead Developer — implement from spec/tasks

- Workflow: [.github/workflows/lead-developer.md](.github/workflows/lead-developer.md)
- Trigger: changes to `specs/**/spec.md` or `specs/**/tasks.md` on `main`.
- Purpose: implement approved scope into tool pages and assets under [tools](tools).
- Output: implementation PRs for human review (not direct merge automation).

### Spec-to-tool synchronization

- If spec or task files change, the Lead Developer workflow runs again to update implementation accordingly.
- PR guard: [.github/workflows/spec-tool-alignment.yml](.github/workflows/spec-tool-alignment.yml) checks that spec/task changes are accompanied by relevant tool/vendor/package updates.
- Intentional planning-only PRs can use `[spec-only]` in PR title or body to bypass the alignment check.

### Managing shared vendor assets

- Keep runtime dependencies in [tools/vendor](tools/vendor) so tools remain portable and reusable across workflows.
- Use npm only as a development-time dependency management workflow.
- After updating dependency versions, run the vendor sync workflow and commit the resulting changes in [package.json](package.json), [package-lock.json](package-lock.json), and [tools/vendor](tools/vendor).

When adding tools:

- keep processing in the browser
- prefer vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- start from [tools/template.html](tools/template.html)
- include [tools/common.css](tools/common.css) and keep only tool-specific styles in `/tools/[feature-slug]/style.css`
- load third-party runtime assets from the shared `/tools/vendor/` directory
- avoid duplicating vendor runtime files inside tool-specific folders when shared copies already exist
- use descriptive titles, meta descriptions, and clear how-to content
- include practical controls such as undo, reset, preview, color selection, or quality settings when relevant
