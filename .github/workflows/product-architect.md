# Intelligence Squad: Product Lead

## Goal
Transform the triggering approved issue into implementation-ready planning artifacts by running `/speckit.plan` and `/speckit.tasks`, then route the result back to the issue as a PR.

Portfolio focus reminder: prioritize tools that replace paywalled or heavily restricted workflows for broad non-technical audiences. De-prioritize low-level developer utilities (for example Base64/JWT/cron helpers) unless the issue includes clear evidence of mainstream, non-technical demand.

## Instructions

**Activation**: This workflow only runs when the `status:approved` label is added to an issue.

### Workflow Steps

1. **Verify Trigger Context**
  - Confirm the triggering label is `status:approved`.
  - Work from the issue that triggered this workflow.
2. **Read the Issue Description**
  - Fetch the triggering issue via the GitHub tool.
  - Treat the issue title and body/description as the source of truth for priorities and constraints.
  - Resolve the target feature slug and existing spec path from the issue body, linked PRs, or referenced files under `specs/**`.
  - If no existing `spec.md` can be confidently identified, do not invent one in this workflow. Add a concise issue comment requesting a spec created via `/speckit.specify`, then stop.
3. **Generate planning artifacts with `/speckit.plan` and `/speckit.tasks`**
  - Invoke `/speckit.plan` using the identified `specs/[feature-slug]/spec.md` as primary input.
  - Ensure the plan stays grounded in the approved issue scope.
  - Invoke `/speckit.tasks` from the generated plan output.
  - Produce/update planning files under `specs/[feature-slug]/` (for example `tasks.md` and any plan artifacts produced by Speckit).
4. **Validate the Output**
  - Ensure plan/tasks are grounded in the triggering issue and existing spec rather than invented scope.
  - Ensure the spec adheres to the "No-Backend" rule in `AGENTS.md`:
    - Browser APIs only (Canvas, File System, Crypto, etc.)
    - No server-side logic
    - GitHub Pages compatible
5. **Raise the Pull Request**
  - Use `create-pull-request` to open a PR containing only generated/updated `specs/**/*` planning files.
  - Use a PR title/body that clearly references the triggering issue.
  - Do **not** include GitHub auto-closing keywords in the PR title or body (for example: `close`, `closes`, `closed`, `fix`, `fixes`, `fixed`, `resolve`, `resolves`, `resolved` followed by an issue reference).
  - Reference the issue in a non-closing way (for example: `Related to #<issue-number>`).
  - Capture the created PR URL.
6. **Comment on the Issue with the PR Link**
  - Post a comment on the same triggering issue after the PR is created.
  - The comment must include a direct link to the created PR.
  - The comment must include direct markdown links to the updated planning files (at minimum `tasks.md`, plus any Speckit plan artifact if produced).
  - Build file links using the repository URL plus the generated branch or PR head ref so links open the exact files created by this run.
  - The comment should feel polished and easy to scan.
  - Mention that planning artifacts have been generated from the approved issue/spec and are ready for review.
  - Use this format:
    ```
    Planning draft ready for review ✅

    I generated planning artifacts from this approved issue/spec and opened a PR for review.

    - PR: [pull-request-url]
    - Tasks: [specs/[feature-slug]/tasks.md]([tasks-file-url])
    - Plan: [specs/[feature-slug]/[plan-file]]([plan-file-url])

    What happens next:
    1. Review the generated plan and task breakdown.
    2. Confirm scope and sequencing still match the approved issue/spec.
    3. Request edits or approve the PR for implementation.
    ```
7. **Failure Handling**
  - If `/speckit.plan`, `/speckit.tasks`, or PR creation fails, leave a concise issue comment stating what failed and what needs human follow-up.
